function U = eshelby_3dcrack(mode, tau, R, mu, nu, X, Z)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function computes the 3D displacement field due to constant stress
% change on a circular crack.

% Input:
% mode   = 1 for antiplane shear in x, 2 for openning mode in y
% tau    = uniform traction change in x
% R      = radius of the circular crack
% mu, nu = shear modulus and Poisson's ratio
% X, Z   = grids of x and z coordinates to compute the displacement at

% Output:
% U      = a structure for displacement field

% Notes:
% For traction in x, a displacement field in x and z is produced.
% For traction in y, a displacement field in y is produced.

% To do:
% Check if the z component displacement is correct for the antiplane shear
% case
